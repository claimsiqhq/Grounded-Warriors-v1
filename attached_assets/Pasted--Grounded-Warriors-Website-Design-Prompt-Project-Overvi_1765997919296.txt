# Grounded Warriors Website Design Prompt

## Project Overview

Design a website for **Grounded Warriors**, a men's healing retreat focused on trauma recovery, father wound work, and reconnection through nature. The retreat takes place off-grid in forest settings and includes cold water immersion, fire ceremonies, fitness, and brotherhood.

## Brand Essence

**Core Concept:** Strength through descent — the counterintuitive truth that growth comes from going *down* (into the body, into the wound, into the earth) rather than up and out.

**Feeling to Evoke:**
- Quiet strength, not aggressive masculinity
- Grounded calm, not anxious energy
- Warm invitation, not cold exclusivity
- Ancient wisdom, not trendy wellness

**This is NOT:**
- A hustle/grind bootcamp
- Spiritual bypassing retreat
- Toxic masculinity reinforcement
- Generic men's group

## Color Palette — Forest Depths

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Night Forest | #0F1A14 | Primary background, hero sections |
| Deep Pine | #1E3328 | Cards, containers, secondary backgrounds |
| Forest Floor | #3D5A47 | Borders, dividers, muted elements |
| Sage | #8FA68F | Headings, emphasis, icon strokes |
| Birch | #C9B896 | Body text, CTAs, accent, warmth |

**Background approach:** Dark-dominant. The site should feel like being in a forest at dusk — enveloping, safe, grounded.

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

**Photography:**
- Moody, atmospheric forest imagery
- Fire at night, embers, smoke
- Cold water (lakes, rivers, ice)
- Men in nature (backs, silhouettes, group shots — not corporate headshots)
- Texture: bark, moss, stone, water
- Color grade: Cool shadows, warm highlights, desaturated

**Imagery to Avoid:**
- Stock photo "businessman meditating"
- Over-produced wellness aesthetics
- Aggressive/military imagery
- Anything that feels like a gym or bootcamp

**Texture & Elements:**
- Subtle grain or noise overlay (organic feel)
- Soft gradients between dark colors
- Generous whitespace (or "darkspace")
- Organic shapes where appropriate (not rigid grids everywhere)

**Icons:**
- Line-weight icons in Sage or Birch
- Nature-inspired where possible (fire, water drop, tree, mountain)
- Simple, not ornate

### Layout Principles

- **Dark-dominant:** Night Forest and Deep Pine backgrounds
- **Generous spacing:** Let content breathe
- **Full-bleed imagery:** Hero sections, photo breaks
- **Cards:** Deep Pine on Night Forest background
- **Text over images:** Use overlays or choose images with dark areas

### Interactive Elements

**Buttons:**
- Primary: Birch background, Night Forest text
- Secondary: Outline in Forest Floor, Sage text
- Hover: Subtle lightening or border glow

**Links:**
- Birch with subtle underline
- Hover: Lighten to #D4C4A6

**Forms:**
- Dark input fields (Deep Pine background)
- Birch borders on focus
- Birch text

## Summary

Design a dark, grounded, warm website that feels like an invitation into the forest — not a sales pitch. The aesthetic should communicate quiet strength, ancient wisdom, and genuine welcome. Every element should reinforce the core message: the way to healing is through descent, not escape.
